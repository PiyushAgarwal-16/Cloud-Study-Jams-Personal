## Troubleshooting

### If error card doesn't appear:
1. Make sure you clicked "Fetch Analytics"
2. Wait for all profiles to be fetched
3. Scroll to the top of the results section

### If copy buttons don't work:
1. Ensure your browser allows clipboard access
2. Check if you're using HTTPS (required for clipboard API in some browsers)
3. Try clicking the button again

### If profile links don't work:
1. Verify the profile URL is valid
2. Check if the profile might be private or deleted
3. Try accessing the profile URL directly in a new tab

## Next Steps

After viewing failed profiles:

1. **Identify Patterns**: Are all errors the same type?
2. **Contact Participants**: Reach out to those with failed profiles
3. **Retry Later**: Network issues might be temporary
4. **Report Issues**: Share error details with technical support if needed
