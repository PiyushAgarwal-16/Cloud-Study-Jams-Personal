# 🎯 Badge Counting Issue FIXED!

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**

Users with 20 completed items now show the correct counts:
- ✅ **19 badges** counted correctly
- ✅ **1 game** counted correctly  
- ✅ **Total: 20 items** as expected

## 🔍 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Title Mismatch - "Cloud Run Functions: 3 Ways"**
**Problem:** Profile shows "Cloud Run Functions: 3 Ways" but allowed list had "Cloud Functions: 3 Ways"

**Solution:** Added `alternateNames` support in configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "Cloud Functions: 3 Ways",
  "alternateNames": ["Cloud Run Functions: 3 Ways"],
  "templateId": "696"
}
```

### **Issue 2: Game URL Mismatch - "Level 3: Generative AI"**
**Problem:** Configuration had wrong URL type (course_templates instead of games)

**Solution:** Fixed the configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "Gen AI Arcade Game: Level 3",
  "alternateNames": ["Level 3: Generative AI"],
  "link": "https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/games/32800",
  "gameId": "32800"
}
```

### **Issue 3: Double-Counting Games**
**Problem:** When users complete a game, they earn a badge with the same name. Both were being extracted and counted.

**Solution:** Updated `extractBadges()` to:
1. First identify all game modals (those with `/games/` URLs)
2. Then extract only badges that are NOT games
3. Games are extracted separately in `extractGames()`

**Result:** "Level 3: Generative AI" now counts ONLY as a game, not as both badge and game

## 🛠️ **Technical Changes**

### **1. Enhanced Configuration Matching**
Updated `pointsCalculator.js` to check alternate names:
```javascript
// Check primary title match
let titleMatch = normalizedAllowedTitle === normalizedBadgeTitle;

// Check alternate names if available  
if (!titleMatch && allowedBadge.alternateNames) {
    titleMatch = allowedBadge.alternateNames.some(altName => {
        const normalizedAltName = altName.toLowerCase().trim().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
        return normalizedAltName === normalizedBadgeTitle;
    });
}
```

### **2. Prevented Double-Counting**
Updated `extractBadges()` in `profileFetcher.js`:
```javascript
// First pass: identify game modals
gameModalIds.add(modalId); // Track games

// Second pass: extract only non-game badges
if (gameModalIds.has(modalId)) {
    return; // Skip this badge, it's actually a game
}
```
