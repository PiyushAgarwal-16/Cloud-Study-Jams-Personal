# 🎉 Profile Fetching Issue RESOLVED!

## ✅ **Problem Fixed**

The Google Cloud Skills Boost Calculator can now **successfully fetch and display skill badges and games data** from public profile links!

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The profile fetcher was using **incorrect CSS selectors** that didn't match the actual HTML structure of Google Cloud Skills Boost profile pages.

### **What Was Wrong:**
- ❌ Generic selectors like `.badge-item`, `.skill-badge`, `.game-item`
- ❌ These selectors don't exist on Google Cloud Skills Boost profile pages
- ❌ Result: 0 badges and 0 games were being extracted

### **What We Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated to use actual selectors: `.profile-badge`, `.ql-title-medium`, `.ql-body-medium`
- ✅ Implemented smart detection for games vs badges using modal dialogs
- ✅ Games are identified by checking if dialog's "Learn more" link contains `/games/`

## 🛠️ **Technical Changes**

### **1. Updated Badge Extraction (`extractBadges`)**
```javascript
// NEW: Correct selectors for Google Cloud Skills Boost
$('.profile-badge').each((index, element) => {
    const title = $badge.find('.ql-title-medium').first().text().trim();
    const earnedText = $badge.find('.ql-body-medium').first().text().trim();
    const badgeUrl = $badge.find('.badge-image').attr('href');
    const imageUrl = $badge.find('.badge-image img').attr('src');
    // Extract and process badge data...
});
```

###  **2. Updated Game Extraction (`extractGames`)**
```javascript
// NEW: Smart game detection via modal dialogs
$('.profile-badge').each((index, element) => {
    const modalId = $badge.find('ql-button').attr('modal');
    const $dialog = $(`#${modalId}`);
    const href = $dialog.find('ql-button[href]').attr('href');
    
    if (href.includes('/games/')) {
        // This is a game! Extract game data...
    }
});
```
