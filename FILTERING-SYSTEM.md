## 🔧 How The Filtering Works

### **1. Matching Logic**
The system matches badges/games using **two methods**:

#### **Method A: Title Matching**
- Normalizes both allowed and completed badge/game titles
- Removes special characters and converts to lowercase
- Example: "Get Started with Cloud Storage" → "getstartedwithcloudstorage"

#### **Method B: URL/ID Matching**
- Matches by `course_templates/{templateId}` for badges
- Matches by `games/{gameId}` for games
- Example: URL contains `/course_templates/726` → matches "The Basics of Google Cloud Compute"

### **2. Filtering Process**
```javascript
// For Badges
const allowedBadges = allBadges.filter(badge => {
    return badge.isCompleted && isBadgeAllowed(badge);
});

// For Games
const allowedGames = allGames.filter(game => {
    return game.isCompleted && isGameAllowed(game);
});
```

### **3. Results Include Filtering Statistics**
```json
{
    "totalPoints": 188,
    "breakdown": {
        "badges": { "points": 120, "count": 1 },
        "games": { "points": 68, "count": 1 }
    },
    "filtering": {
        "allowedBadgesTotal": 20,
        "filteredBadges": [
            {
                "title": "Some Random Badge",
                "reason": "Not in allowed skill badges list"
            }
        ],
        "filteredGames": [
            {
                "title": "Some Random Game", 
                "reason": "Not in allowed skill badges list"
            }
        ]
    },
    "metadata": {
        "filteringEnabled": true,
        "calculatedAt": "2025-10-15T...",
        "configVersion": "1.0"
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Testing Results

### ✅ **Verified Filtering Behavior**
- ✅ **Badges in allowed list**: Counted and awarded points
- ✅ **Badges NOT in allowed list**: Filtered out (0 points)
- ✅ **Games in allowed list**: Counted and awarded points  
- ✅ **Games NOT in allowed list**: Filtered out (0 points)

### **Test Case Example:**
```
Input: 4 completed items
- "The Basics of Google Cloud Compute" ← ✅ IN LIST
- "Random Badge Not in List" ← ❌ FILTERED OUT
- "App Building with Appsheet" ← ✅ IN LIST  
- "Random Game Not in List" ← ❌ FILTERED OUT

Result: Only 2 items counted, 2 items filtered
Total Points: 188 (from 2 allowed items only)
```
