# 100% Completion Date Filter

## Overview
This feature allows you to filter participants who reached 100% completion (all 19 skill badges + 1 game = 20 items total) **after** a specific cutoff date.

## How It Works

### Definition of "Reached 100% After Date"
A participant is included in the filter results if they completed their 20th item (the final item needed to reach 100%) after the specified cutoff date.

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Completed Before Cutoff
- **Cutoff Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Participant Progress**:
  - Before Oct 10: 20/20 items completed (100%)
  - After Oct 10: No new completions
- **Result**: ‚ùå NOT included (already at 100% before cutoff)

#### Scenario 2: Reached 100% After Cutoff
- **Cutoff Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Participant Progress**:
  - Before Oct 10: 15 badges + 1 game = 16/20 items (80%)
  - After Oct 10: Completed 4 more badges
  - Final completion date: October 15, 2025
- **Result**: ‚úÖ INCLUDED (reached 100% on Oct 15, which is after Oct 10)

#### Scenario 3: Partial Completion After Cutoff
- **Cutoff Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Participant Progress**:
  - Before Oct 10: 10 badges + 0 games = 10/20 items (50%)
  - After Oct 10: Completed 5 more badges
  - Current status: 15/20 items (75%)
- **Result**: ‚ùå NOT included (hasn't reached 100% yet)

#### Scenario 4: Perfect Example
- **Cutoff Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Participant Progress**:
  - Before Oct 10: 19 badges + 0 games = 19/20 items (95%)
  - Oct 15, 2025: Completed the final game
- **Result**: ‚úÖ INCLUDED (reached 100% on Oct 15 by completing the game)

## How to Use

1. **Fetch Analytics Data**
   - Click "üîÑ Fetch Latest Data" in the Analytics section
   - Wait for all participant data to be fetched

2. **Select Filter Criteria**
   - In the "Advanced Completion Date Filters" section:
     - Select a cutoff date (e.g., 10/10/2025)
     - Choose "üéØ 100% Progress Reached After Date" from the dropdown
   - Click "üîç Find Participants"

3. **View Results**
   - The system will display all participants who reached 100% after your selected date
   - Each result shows:
     - Participant name
     - Date when 100% was reached
     - Which item was the final one (the 20th item)
     - How many items they had before the cutoff
     - Link to their profile

## Result Display

For each participant in the results, you'll see:

```
John Doe üîó
üéØ Reached 100% on Oct 15, 2025 ‚Ä¢ Final item: Gen AI Arcade Game: Level 3 (game) ‚Ä¢ Had 19/20 before cutoff
```

This tells you:
- The participant reached 100% on October 15, 2025
- Their final completing item was a game
- They had 19 out of 20 items completed before the cutoff date
- They completed 1 item after the cutoff to reach 100%

## Technical Details

### Algorithm
1. Identify participants with 100% completion (19 badges + 1 game)
2. Collect all completion dates for their badges and games
3. Sort completion dates chronologically
4. Check the date of the 20th item (index 19 in sorted array)
5. If this date is after the cutoff date, include the participant

### Data Requirements
- Detailed badge completion dates (`earnedDate`)
- Detailed game completion dates (`completedDate`)
- All badges and games must have valid date stamps

## Use Cases

1. **Program Tracking**: Identify who completed the program within a specific time window
2. **Deadline Compliance**: Find participants who finished after a program deadline
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track momentum and completion patterns over time
4. **Recognition**: Identify participants who completed everything in a final push

## Export Options

The filter results can be exported:
- **JSON**: Includes all detailed completion data
- **CSV**: Simplified format for spreadsheet analysis

Both export formats include:
- Participant name
- Completion date
- Items completed before/after cutoff
- Profile URL

## Notes

- Only participants with `status: 'success'` are considered
- Participants must have exactly 19 badges + 1 game to be eligible
- The 20th item (regardless of type) determines the 100% completion date
- Dates are compared using midnight (00:00:00) of the selected date
