**Scenario**: You want to find participants who completed the program after October 10, 2025.

1. Select date: `10/10/2025`
2. Select filter: `🎯 100% Progress Reached After Date`
3. Click `🔍 Find Participants`

**Result**: You'll see participants like:
```
John Doe 🔗                                    4 new
🎯 Reached 100% on Oct 15, 2025 • Final item: Gen AI Arcade Game: Level 3 (game) • Had 16/20 before cutoff

This means John had 16 items done by Oct 10, then completed 4 more items, reaching 100% on Oct 15 when he finished the game.
